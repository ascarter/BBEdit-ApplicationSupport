About the BBEdit support folder
-------------------------------

This folder contains files and folders which define or extend BBEditâ€™s
capabilities. Below is a quick summary of each item's purpose. For
detailed information about its contents, please refer to Chapter 2 of
the BBEdit User Manual.

(This document is written in
[Markdown](http://www.daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). It's
readable as plain text, but prettier if you choose "Preview in BBEdit"
from the "Markup" menu.)

*	Attachment Scripts

	Contains AppleScript scripts which are run at specific points in
	BBEdit's execution: when the application starts, is quit or slept
	(with the "Sleep BBEdit" command); and when documents are open,
	saved, and closed.
	
*	Auto-Save Recovery

	Contains information that helps BBEdit recover your unsaved
	documents after a crash (system crash or otherwise), as well as
	restore them when starting after a "Sleep BBEdit" command. Removing
	items from this folder can cause data loss.
	
*	Clippings
	
	Items in this folder appear on BBEdit's "Clippings" menu. Use
	folders to organize the clippings into "Sets"; if a set's folder is
	named with a file name suffix that maps to a particular language,
	the set is automatically made active when a document in that
	language is active. You can find lots of useful clippings sets in
	the [BBEdit clippings
	library](http://www.barebones.com/support/bbedit/clippings_library.
	html).
	
*	Completion Data
	
	This folder contains tags files in the format generated by `bbedit
	--maketags` (the [exuberant ctags](http://ctags.sourceforge.net/)
	format). Each folder in here corresponds to a named language; any
	tags files are used to generate text completions when editing files
	in that language.
	
*	HTML Templates
	
	Templates used for the "New HTML Document" command live in this
	folder; they will appear in the "Template:" pop-up menu in the New
	HTML Document dialog.
	
*	Language Modules
	
	If you wish to add support for syntax coloring and function
	navigation for additional languages, place a language module here.
	Language modules may be
	[compiled](http://www.barebones.com/support/developer.html) or
	codeless (see appendix D of the BBEdit user manual).
	
	**Note**: Do not open the BBEdit application package to extract or
	modify the language modules in there. That way lies madness.
	
*	Menu Scripts

	This folder contains AppleScript scripts which attach to specific
	menu commands. The easiest way to manage these is by using the
	controls in the "Menus" preferences.
	
*	Plug-Ins

	Items in this folder are compiled plug-ins which appear on the Tools
	menu. [Learn about writing your own, if you
	dare.](http://www.barebones.com/support/developer.html)
	
*	Scratchpad
	
	This file contains the contents of the Scratchpad. Removing this file
	will cause the contents of your Scratchpad to be lost.
	
*	Scripts

	Items in this folder appear on the Scripts menu.
	
*	Startup Items

	Items in this folder are opened when BBEdit starts up; if any
	items are scripts, they will be run; and if they are applications,
	BBEdit will launch them.
	
*	Stationery

	Files in this folder appear on the "New with Stationery" submenu
	of the file menu.
	
*	Text Factories

	Save a text factory in this folder, and it will appear on both the
	Text Factories menu in the menu bar, and on the "Apply Text Factory"
	submenu on the Text menu.
	
*	Unix Support

	In here are two folders and a file:
	
	*	Unix Filters
	
		These appear under the "Unix Filters" submenu of the `#!` menu.
		Filters operate on the frontmost document. Either the current 
		selection (if any) or the entire document will be passed as input 
		to the filter as a temp file in `argv[1]`, and any output generated 
		by the filter will replace the selection (or the contents of the
		document).
	
	*	Unix Scripts
	
		These appear under the "Unix Scripts" submenu of the `#!` menu.
		The content of the front document is available as `stdin`, but
		any data written to `stdout` goes to a Unix Script Output window.
	
	*	Unix Script Output
	
		This file contains the output of Unix scripts run from the
		"Unix Scripts" submenu of the `#!` menu.

	For more details on using Unix filters and scripts, please see Chapter 14
	of BBEdit's PDF manual (choose "User Manual" from the Help menu).
