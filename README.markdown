==========================

BBEdit extensions, tags, scripts, and other helpers.

# Install

	git clone git@github.com:ascarter/BBEdit-ApplicationSupport.git ~/Library/Application\ Support/BBEdit
	cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/BBEdit
	./init.sh

The `init.sh` script will create all the empty directories for BBEdit's support directory if they don't already exist.
